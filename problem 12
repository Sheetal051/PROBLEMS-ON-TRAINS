Q: Two stations P and Q are 110 km apart on a straight track. One train starts from P at 7 a.m. and travels towards Q at 20 kmph. Another train starts from Q at 8 a.m. and travels towards P at a speed of 25 kmph. At what time will they meet?
A. 10:30
B. 10:00
C. 8.45
D. 9:30
Ans:
Let's break this problem down step by step:

The distance between the two stations is 110 km.
The first train travels from P to Q at 20 kmph, starting at 7 a.m.
The second train travels from Q to P at 25 kmph, starting at 8 a.m.
Since the second train starts 1 hour after the first train, we need to find out how far the first train has traveled in that 1 hour.

Distance traveled by the first train in 1 hour = Speed x Time = 20 kmph x 1 hour = 20 km

So, the first train has covered 20 km in the first hour. Now, the distance between the two trains is:
110 km - 20 km = 90 km

Both trains are now traveling towards each other. To find the time at which they will meet, we can use the concept of relative speed.

Relative speed = Speed of first train + Speed of second train = 20 kmph + 25 kmph = 45 kmph
Time taken for the two trains to meet = Distance / Relative speed = 90 km / 45 kmph = 2 hours

Since the second train started at 8 a.m., we add the 2 hours to find the meeting time:
Meeting time = 8 a.m. + 2 hours = 10 a.m.

The correct answer is B. 10:00.
