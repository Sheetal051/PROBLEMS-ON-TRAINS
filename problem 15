Q:A train without stoppage travels with an average speed of 72 km/h and with stop page, it travels with an average speed of 60 km/h. For how many minutes does the train stop on an average per hour?
A. 6
B. 8
C. 10
D. 12

Ans:
To find the time wasted per hour for the stoppage, we can use the formula:
Time wasted per hour = ((S - S1) / S) * 60

where S is the speed without stoppage (72 km/h) and S1 is the speed with stoppage (60 km/h).

Plugging in the values, we get:
Time wasted per hour = ((72 - 60) / 72) * 60 = (12 / 72) * 60 = 10 minutes

However, we can simplify the calculation:
Time wasted per hour = (12 / 72) * 60 = (1 / 6) * 60 = 10 minutes

But wait, 1/6 is equal to 0.1666... which is approximately 0.17. So, we can rewrite the equation as:
Time wasted per hour = 0.17 * 60 = 10.2 minutes

Rounding up to the nearest whole number, we get:
Time wasted per hour â‰ˆ 12 minutes

So, the correct answer is D. 12 minutes.
