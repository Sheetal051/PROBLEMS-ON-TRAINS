Q: Two trains running in opposite direction cross a man standing on the platform in 36 seconds and 26 seconds respectively. The trains cross each other in 30 seconds. What is the ratio of their speeds?
A. 4/6
B. 3/9
C. 4/8
D. 2/4
Ans:
Let's break down the problem step by step:

Let the speed of the first train be x km/hr and the speed of the second train be y km/hr.

Since the first train crosses the man standing on the platform in 36 seconds, the length of the first train can be calculated as:
Length of first train = Speed of first train x Time = x km/hr x 36/3600 km = 36x/3600 km = 0.01x km

Similarly, the length of the second train can be calculated as:

Length of second train = Speed of second train x Time = y km/hr x 26/3600 km = 26y/3600 km = 0.00722y km

Now, when the two trains cross each other, the relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds:

Relative speed = x + y km/hr

The time taken for the trains to cross each other is 30 seconds, so the combined length of the two trains can be calculated as:

Combined length = Relative speed x Time = (x + y) km/hr x 30/3600 km = 30(x + y)/3600 km = 0.00833(x + y) km

Since the combined length is equal to the sum of the individual lengths, we can set up the equation:
0.00833(x + y) = 0.01x + 0.00722y

Simplifying the equation, we get:
0.00833x + 0.00833y = 0.01x + 0.00722y

Subtracting 0.00833x from both sides gives:
0.00833y = 0.00167x + 0.00722y

Subtracting 0.00722y from both sides gives:
0.00111y = 0.00167x

Dividing both sides by 0.00111y gives:
1 = 0.00151x/y

Multiplying both sides by y/x gives
y/x = 1/0.00151

y/x = 664.24/1

y/x ≈ 664/1

y/x ≈ 2/3

So, the ratio of their speeds is 2:3.

The correct answer is D, 2/4, which is equivalent to 2:3.
