Q: Time is taken by two trains running in opposite directions to cross a man standing on the platform in 28 seconds and 18 seconds respectively. It took 26 seconds for the trains to cross each other. What is the ratio of their speeds?
A. 2:3
B. 3:2
C. 3:1
D. 4:1
Ans:
Let's break this problem down step by step:

Let the speed of the first train be v1 and the speed of the second train be v2.

The time taken by the first train to cross the man standing on the platform is 28 seconds. The distance covered by the train is its own length, which we'll call L1. The speed of the train is:
v1 = L1 / 28
The time taken by the second train to cross the man standing on the platform is 18 seconds. The distance covered by the train is its own length, which we'll call L2. The speed of the train is:
v2 = L2 / 18

When the trains cross each other, they cover a distance equal to the sum of their lengths (L1 + L2) in 26 seconds. The relative speed between them is the sum of their speeds:
v1 + v2 = (L1 + L2) / 26

Substitute the expressions for v1 and v2 from steps 2 and 3:
(L1 / 28) + (L2 / 18) = (L1 + L2) / 26

Simplify the equation:
(18L1 + 28L2) / 504 = (L1 + L2) / 26

Cross-multiply:
18L1 + 28L2 = 21L1 + 21L2

Simplify the equation:
7L2 = 3L1 L2 / L1 = 3/7

Now, substitute L2 / L1 into the expressions for v1 and v2:
v1 = L1 / 28 v2 = (3/7)L1 / 18

Simplify the expressions:
v1 = L1 / 28 v2 = (1/14)L1

The ratio of their speeds is:
v1 : v2 = L1 / 28 : (1/14)L1 = 14 : 1 = 4 : 1

So, the correct answer is D. 4:1.
