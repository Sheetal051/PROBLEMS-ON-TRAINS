Q: Two trains are moving towards each other with speeds 40 km/hr and 45 km/hr from different stations P and Q. When they meet the second train from station Q has covered 20 km more distance than the first train which starts from station P. What is the distance between the two stations?
A. 300 km
B. 320 km
C. 340 km
D. 360 km
Ans:
Let's analyze the situation:
To find the distance between the two stations, let's denote:

𝑆1=40 km/hr (speed of the first train from station P)
𝑆2=45 km/hr (speed of the second train from station Q)

Let the time taken for the trains to meet be t hours.

Since the second train from station Q has covered 20 km more than the first train from station P, we can write:
S2⋅t=S1⋅t+20
Substituting the values of 𝑆1and S2 :
45t=40t+20

Solving for t:
45t−40t=20
5t=20
t=4 hours

In 4 hours, the first train covers:

Distance covered by the first train=
S1⋅t=40⋅4=160 km
The second train covers:
Distance covered by the second train=
S2⋅t=45⋅4=180 km

The total distance between the two stations is the sum of the distances covered by both trains:

Total distance=160 km+180 km=340 km

Therefore, the distance between the two stations is:
C. 340 km
