Q: A train moves past a telegraph post and a bridge 264 m long in 8 seconds and 20 seconds respectively. What is the speed of the train?
A. 69.5 km/hr
B. 70 km/hr
C. 79 km/hr
D. 79.2 km/hr
Ans:
Let's break down the problem step by step
The train moves past a telegraph post in 8 seconds, so the distance covered is the length of the train (L). The speed of the train is:
v = L / 8

The train moves past a bridge 264 meters long in 20 seconds, so the distance covered is the sum of the length of the train and the bridge (L + 264). The speed of the train is:
v = (L + 264) / 20

Equating the two expressions for v, we get:
L / 8 = (L + 264) / 20

Simplifying the equation, we get:
20L = 8L + 2112 12L = 2112 L = 176 meters

Now, we can find the speed of the train:
v = L / 8 = 176 / 8 = 22 meters per second

To convert the speed from meters per second to kilometers per hour, we can use the conversion formula:
1 km/hr = 5/18 m/sec

So, the speed of the train is:
v = 22 m/sec = 22 Ã— (18/5) km/hr = 69.5 km/hr

Therefore, the correct answer is A. 69.5 km/hr.
