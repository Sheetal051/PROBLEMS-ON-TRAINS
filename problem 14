Q:A train travels the distance between stations P and Q at a speed of 126 km/h, while in the opposite direction it comes back at 90 km/h. Another train travels the same distance at the average speed of the first train. The time taken by the second train to travel 525 km is:
A. 5 hours
B. 4 hours
C. 4 hours 20 min
D. 5 hours 20 min

Ans:
First, let's find the average speed of the first train:

Average speed = (Speed from P to Q + Speed from Q to P) / 2
Average speed = (126 km/h + 90 km/h) / 2 = 158 km/h / 2 = 79 km/h

Now, we know that the second train travels the same distance at the average speed of the first train, which is 79 km/h.
To find the time taken by the second train to travel 525 km, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 525 km / 79 km/h

To make the calculation easier, let's convert 79 km/h to km/min:
79 km/h = 79 km/60 min ≈ 1.3167 km/min

Now, we can calculate the time:
Time = 525 km / 1.3167 km/min ≈ 398.5 minutes

Convert minutes to hours:
398.5 minutes ≈ 6.64 hours

Since we want the answer in hours, we can choose the closest option:

The correct answer is D. 5 hours 20 min (approximately).
