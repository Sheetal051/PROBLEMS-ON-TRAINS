Q: Two trains of length 125 meters and 115 meters are running on parallel tracks. When they run in the same direction the faster train crosses the slower train in 30 seconds and when they run in opposite direction, they cross each other in 10 seconds. What is the speed of each train?
 A. 18,6
 B. 16,8
 C. 14,7
 D. 20,5

Ans:
Let's break this problem down step by step:

When the trains run in the same direction, the relative speed between them is the difference between their speeds. Let's call the speed of the faster train "v1" and the speed of the slower train "v2". The relative speed is v1 - v2.

The faster train crosses the slower train in 30 seconds, which means it covers a distance equal to the sum of their lengths (125 + 115 = 240 meters) in 30 seconds. So, the relative speed is:
v1 - v2 = Distance / Time = 240 meters / 30 seconds = 8 meters/second

When the trains run in opposite directions, the relative speed between them is the sum of their speeds. The relative speed is v1 + v2.

The trains cross each other in 10 seconds, which means they cover a distance equal to the sum of their lengths (240 meters) in 10 seconds. So, the relative speed is:
v1 + v2 = Distance / Time = 240 meters / 10 seconds = 24 meters/second

Now we have two equations:
v1 - v2 = 8 meters/second ... (1) v1 + v2 = 24 meters/second ... (2)

Add equation (1) and equation (2) to eliminate v2:
2v1 = 32 meters/second v1 = 16 meters/second

Now, substitute v1 into equation (1) to find v2:
16 - v2 = 8 v2 = 8 meters/second

Convert the speeds from meters/second to km/h:
v1 = 16 meters/second = 16 × (3600 / 1000) = 57.6 km/h ≈ 58 km/h v2 = 8 meters/second = 8 × (3600 / 1000) = 28.8 km/h ≈ 29 km/h

So, the speeds of the two trains are approximately 58 km/h and 29 km/h.

The closest answer choice is B. 16,8.
