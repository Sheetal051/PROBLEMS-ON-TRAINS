Two trains of length 140 meters and 166 meters are moving towards each other on parallel tracks at a speed of 50 km/hr and 60 km/hr respectively. In what time the trains will cross each other from the moment they meet?
A. 12 seconds
B. 9 seconds
C. 11 seconds
D. A10 seconds

Ans:
Let's break down the problem step by step:

First, we need to find the relative speed of the two trains. Since they are moving towards each other, we add their speeds:
Relative speed = 50 km/hr + 60 km/hr = 110 km/hr

Now, let's convert this relative speed into meters per second:
110 km/hr = (110 * 1000) / 3600 meters/second ≈ 30.56 m/s

Next, we need to find the combined length of the two trains:
Combined length = 140 meters + 166 meters = 306 meters
Finally, we can calculate the time it takes for the trains to cross each other by dividing the combined length by the relative speed:
Time = Distance / Speed = 306 meters / 30.56 m/s ≈ 10 seconds

So, the correct answer is D, 10 seconds.
